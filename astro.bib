Many of these galaxies contain central cores with rotation axes skew or antiparallel to the rotation axes of the disks; skew and counterrotating outer gas disks are also known. Some of these multi-spin galaxies, and their likely formation as merger products are discussed.},

The atlas includes kinematically confirmed polar-ring galaxies (category A), good condidates based on their morphological appearance (category B), possible candidates (category C), and possibly related objects (category D). New photometric and kinematic observations are reported for several galaxies in the catalog, including observations that show that UGC 7576 and UGC 9796 ( = II ZW 73) are S0 galaxies with polar rings. Roughly 0.5 percent of all nearby S0 galaxies appear to have polar rings. When corrected for various selection effects (e.g., nonoptimal viewing orientation, possible dimming, or limited lifetime of the ring) the percentage increases to about 5 percent of S0 galaxies which have, or have had a polar ring.},

These striking galaxies challenge our understanding of how galaxies form; the origin of their distinct components has remained uncertain, and the subject of much debate. We use high-resolution cosmological simulations of galaxy formation to show that Polar Ring Galaxies are simply an extreme example of the angular moment misalignment that occurs during the hierarchical structure formation characteristic of Cold Dark Matter cosmology. In our model, Polar Ring Galaxies form through the continuous accretion of gas whose angular momentum is misaligned with the central galaxy.},

  abstract = {We compare estimates of stellar mass, M * , and dynamical mass, M d , for a sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Under the assumption of dynamical homology (i.e., ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/722/1/1/apj351887ieqn1.gif] {$\tilde{M}_{\rm d}\sim \sigma _0^2 R_{\rm e}$} , where σ 0 is the central velocity dispersion and R e is the effective radius), we find a tight but strongly nonlinear relation between the two mass estimates: the best-fit relation is ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/722/1/1/apj351887ieqn2.gif] {$M_* \propto \tilde{M}_{\rm d}^{0.73}$} , with an observed scatter of 0.15 dex. We also find that, at fixed M * , the ratio ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/722/1/1/apj351887ieqn3.gif] {$M_*/\tilde{M}_{\rm d}$} depends strongly on galaxy structure, as parameterized by the Sérsic index, n . The size of the differential effect is on the order of 0.6 dex across 2 < n < 10. The apparent n -dependence of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/722/1/1/apj351887ieqn4.gif] {$M_*/\tilde{M}_{\rm d}$} is qualitatively and quantitatively similar to expectations from simple, spherical and isotropic dynamical models, indicating that assuming homology gives the wrong dynamical mass. To explore this possibility, we have also derived dynamical mass estimates that explicitly account for differences in galaxies' structures. Using this "structure-corrected" dynamical mass estimator, M d, n , the best-fit relation is M * ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/vprop.gif] {vprop} M 0.92±0.01(±0.08) d, n with an observed scatter of 0.13 dex. While the data are thus consistent with a linear relation, they do prefer a slightly shallower slope. Further, we see only a small residual trend in M * / M d, n with n . We find no statistically significant systematic trends in M * / M d, n as a function of observed quantities (e.g., apparent magnitude, redshift), or as a function of tracers of stellar populations (e.g., Hα equivalent width, mean stellar age), nor do we find significantly different behavior for different kinds of galaxies (i.e.,central versus satellite galaxies, emission versus non-emission galaxies). At 99% confidence, the net differential bias in M * / M d, n across a wide range of stellar populations and star formation activities is ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 0.12 dex ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 40%). The very good agreement between stellar mass and structure-corrected dynamical mass strongly suggests, but does not unambiguously prove, that (1) galaxy non-homology has a major impact on dynamical mass estimates, and (2) there are no strong systematic biases in the stellar mass-to-light ratios derived from broadband optical spectral energy distributions. Further, accepting the validity of both our stellar and dynamical mass estimates, these results suggest that the central dark-to-luminous mass ratio has a relatively weak mass dependence, but a very small scatter at fixed mass.},
